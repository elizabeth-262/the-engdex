    <p class="text">
    Initially, The Engdex was created to solve a common problem amongst future students. That is, when researching engineering disciplines much of the existing information were brief, short and impersonable program summaries published by institutions. On the other hand, if students wanted more truth that meant seeking out open-forums with jarringly discouraging experiences and opinions — there was also a fair chance that these experiences were fabricated by individuals who didn’t even attend the schools or programs that their hate posts revolved around.  
      <br></br>
      Our contributors understand the vastly different ends of this spectrum so we strive for The Engdex to be a reliable medium that provides informative yet realistic descriptions of each discipline in both education and career sectors. Whether you're a student looking to pursue a career in Engineering, or simply someone who is curious about the field, The Engdex has something for everyone. Our articles and interviews are designed to be accessible to all, regardless of level of knowledge or experience.
