    <!--Intro-->
    <p class="text">
      While our members were researching engineering programs, they found it difficult to find reliable yet realistic descriptions. They were met with brief summaries written from institutions or discouraging and likely false posts from open-forum sites. In response, <em>The Engdex</em> was created to combat these opposing representations and provide a reliable medium for anybody seeking informative yet honest ressources. 
      <br></br>
      Whether you're a student looking to pursue a career in Engineering, or simply someone who is curious about the field, The Engdex has something for everyone. Our articles and interviews are designed to be accessible to all, regardless of their level of knowledge or experience.
