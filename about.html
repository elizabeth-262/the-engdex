    <!--Intro-->
    <p class="text">
  <i>The Engdex </i> was created to address the lack of reliable and realistic information available to high school students interested in engineering. Many existing resources were either brief summaries published by institutions and the other option that offered a bit more reality were open-forums where seemingly existing students provided discouraging and likely false experiences. As a result, The Engdex aims to be a reliable medium that offers informative yet realistic descriptions of each discipline in education and career.
  
      <br></br>
      Whether you're a student looking to pursue a career in Engineering, or simply someone who is curious about the field, The Engdex has something for everyone. Our articles and interviews are designed to be accessible to all, regardless of level of knowledge or experience.
